# Peer Review
Peer review for Lab 3 of [Lorenzo Bonannella s317985](https://github.com/lorenzobn/computational_intelligence/tree/main/lab_09)

## Intro
Hi Lorenzo ✌️.

Firstly, good work👍🏻!
The code is clear, easy to read and also well-structured.
It's also a complete code because you have tried a lot of solutions for this problem, nice! 

It would have been more comfortable anyway to evaluate the code if the `README.md`
file had included some information about it or also with some comments, they are always nice to have.

However, the results section is very well written, also describing the choices made while writing the code.

## Code
The base EA algorithm is well implemented, so nothing to say about it, well done!

Also for the Diversity, you have gone a great work choosing parents based on how different they are, a nice idea!

## Ending
I hope you'll find this review useful and good luck for the next labs 😉!
