# Peer Review
Peer review for Lab 2 of [Alessio Cappello s309450](https://github.com/AlessioCappello2/computational-intelligence/tree/main/labs)

## Intro
Hi Alessio ✌️.

Firstly, good work👍🏻! The ``README.md`` is very well written and therefore was beneficial for quickly understanding your work.
I also really appreciated your code style since it is very clear.

## The code

I hadn't thought about the choice of playing the algorithm against ``pure_random``, assuming that the best choice was to send it against the optimal. 
However, I must say that the results look very good even with ``pure_random``. I will definitely try to see if in my solution anything changes.

The only thing I recommend changing is the ``fitness`` function as your algorithm always starts first against pure_random.
It would be better if there was fairness between the algorithms in the number of times one of them starts playing.
By the way, I also realized this thanks to the reviews😅.

## Ending
After all, that's a great job. Congratulations!.
I hope you'll find this review useful and good luck for the next labs 😉!
