## Labs
- Lab 01 (in the `Lab 1` directory): Implement $A^*$ for the Set Covering Problem. The solution can be found in the _Lab 01_ section of the Notebook.

- Lab 02 (in the `Lab 2` directory): Implement a **Rule-based agent** and an **Evolved agent** using an _ES_ strategy to play the Nim game. The solution can be found in the Notebook inside the directory.

- Lab 03 (in the `Lab 3` directory): Solve the *Black-box Problem* instances 1, 2, 5, and 10 on a 1000-loci genomes, using a minimum number of fitness calls. The solution can be found in the Notebook inside the directory.

- Lab 04 (in the `Lab 4` directory): Use **reinforcement learning** to devise a *Tic-Tac-Toe player*. The solution can be found in the Notebook inside the directory.

- Final Project (in the `quixo` directory): Use **reinforcement learning** and **MinMax** to devise a *Quixo player*. The solution can be found in the Notebook inside the directory.
